        UXPA
    </h3>

    <p>
        UXPA strives to give UX students oportunities to gain expreience outside of the classroom. 
        As the founding treasurer of UXPA, Penn State Chapter, I have put in a lot of work to get the club started. 
        Leading meetings, recruiting members, and working to become a recognized club are some of my tasks. 
        We haven't currently finished any projects, but we are well on our way.

    <h3>
        Zoom-bot
    </h3>

    <p>
        The Zoom-bot is an interactive navigation and maintence interface that could be implemented on subways and trains all over the world to improve riders experience.
        It should assist users by cleaning the train and giving them information including directions and air quality. 
        The Zoom-bot will also keep track of train cleanliness and alert maintenance workers of problems. 
        Subway employees will be using the interface to track trains’ cleanliness and location. The high fidelity wireframes have been developed.
