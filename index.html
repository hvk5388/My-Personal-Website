                I’m Hannah, a Sophomore at Penn State University, excited to explore where tech can lead me. I am studying Human Centered Design and Development (HCDD), and want to pursue a career in UX Design. When I was deciding what I wanted to do with my life two passions stood out to me, people and technology. I want to make a positive difference in the world. These passions lead me to where I am today. That is, aspiring to make technology easily accessible and seeking to design useful products to assist in daily activities.

                        The Zoom-bot is an interactive navigation and maintence interface that could be implemented on subways and trains all over the world to improve riders experience.
                        It should assist users by cleaning the train and giving them information including directions and air quality. 
                        The Zoom-bot will also keep track of train cleanliness and alert maintenance workers of problems. 
                        Subway employees will be using the interface to track trains’ cleanliness and location. The high fidelity wireframes have been developed.

                        My team and I designed an app for finding best-rated local food. 
                        The user is able to save notes, post them as reviews, and send them to others.
                        We collaborated to use Zomato API on the app.
                        I employed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the creation of the application.
