                I’m Hannah, a Sophomore at Penn State University, excited to explore where tech can lead me. I am studying Human Centered Design and Development (HCDD), and want to pursue a career in UX Design. When I was deciding what I wanted to do with my life two passions stood out to me, people and technology. These interests led me to where I am today. That is, aspiring to make technology easily accessible and seeking to design useful products to assist in daily activities. I want to make a positive difference in the world.

                        UXPA strives to give UX students oportunities to gain experience outside of the classroom. 
                        As the founding treasurer of UXPA, Penn State Chapter, I have put in a lot of time and effort to get the club started. 
                        Leading meetings, recruiting members, and working to become a recognized club are some of the ways I have assisted. 
                        I am currently the Project Manager for the JamPacks project to redesign their website.
                        They are a startup besed in Montana, working to create backpacks built for you.
                        I work as a liason between my team and the client, as well as assist in website functionality.

                        The Zoom-bot is an interactive navigation and maintence interface that could be implemented on subways and trains all over the world to improve riders experience.
                        It assists various calssifications of users in three parts, maintenance, navigation, and air quality.
                        The Zoom-bot will keep track of train cleanliness and alert maintenance workers of problems. 
                        Subway employees will be using the interface to track trains’ cleanliness and location. 
                        Riders will find benefits of the system through its air purifier and vaccuming as well as viewing navigation tips.
                        The high fidelity wireframes of the interfaces have been developed.

                        My team and I designed an app for finding best-rated local food. 
                        The user is able to save notes, post them as reviews, and send them to others.
                        We collaborated to use Zomato API on the app.
                        I employed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the creation of the application.
