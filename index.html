                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Iâ€™m Hannah, a Senior at Penn State University, excited to explore where tech can lead me. I am studying Human Centered Design and Development (HCDD), and want to pursue a career in UX Design or Front End Web Development. When I was deciding what I wanted to do with my life two passions stood out to me, people and technology. These interests led me to where I am today. That is, aspiring to make technology easily accessible and seeking to design useful products to assist in daily activities. I want to make a positive difference in the world.

                        Lowe's Internship
                    </h3>

                    <p class="projectdescriptions">
                        During the summer of 2022 I worked as a software engineering intern at Lowe's.
                        This was a great opportunity for me to participat on an Agile team withing the ECommerce Group.
                        We ran the Item Search and Maintenece tab on the Enterprise Item Portal (vendor website).
                        I designed UI fixes and feature requests under the direction of senior developers.
                        In order to understand the website we ran, I also constructed React.js prototype of the internal data driven website.
                        Through ESLint I gained experience linting our entire code repository by implementing new rules.
                        To improve the onboarding expereince I also created Confluence documentation.
                        At the end of my time at Lowe's, my Hack-a-Thon team was awarded 1st place for designing a Neo4j graph database. 
                        We evaluated the Lowe's model and found inconsitencies with the framework and wanted to explain the tech structure and team dependecies better.

                        HAX-The-Web
                    </h3>

                    <p class="projectdescriptions">
                        I have worked with HAX-The-Web, an open source content management system, completing an Independent Study and many projects. 
                        I worked alongside professors, professionals, and peers to contribute to the GitHub repository. 
                        I test and solve issues in the queue in order to keep the system working properly and improving. 
                        One such issue was the vocab-term, created with JavaScript. 
                        The vocab-term web component was made in order to add an element that will allow a tooltip definition. 
                        You can change the text, definition, and add pictures.

                        Meal Plan App
                    </h3>

                    <p class="projectdescriptions">
                        One of my favorite tools to use has been Android Studio. 
                        With Java, I have designed and developed an app start to finish on Android Studio. 
                        I worked on a small team as the lead developer in order to code the functionality of the meal plan app. 
                        My favorite method for this was the grocery list. 
                        I allowed users to add an item to shared preferences and dynamically changed the size of the list. 
                        This was a very difficult challenge and I learned a lot about Java, Android Studio, and working on a difficult team.
