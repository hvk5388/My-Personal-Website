#Zoom-bot
The Zoom-bot is an interactive navigation and maintence interface that could be implemented on subways and trains all over the world to improve riders experience. It should assist users by cleaning the train and giving them information including directions and air quality. The Zoom-bot will also keep track of train cleanliness and alert maintenance workers of problems. Subway employees will be using the interface to track trainsâ€™ cleanliness and location. The high fidelity wireframes have been developed. 
#Clinique Virtual Reality
Clinique Virtual Reality is a way to experience personalized cosmetic advice from any location, at any time. It allows the user to scan their face, view the problem areas, and recommends products and solutions. I worked on creating high fiedlity wireframes for the application.
#UXPA
UXPA strives to give UX students oportunities to gain expreience outside of the classroom. As the founding treasurer of UXPA, Penn State Chapter, I have put in a lot of work to get the club started. Leading meetings, recruiting members, and working to become a recognized club are some of my tasks. We haven't currently finished any projects, but we are well on our way.
